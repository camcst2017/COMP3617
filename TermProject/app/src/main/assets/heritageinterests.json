The period between the two World Wars was a time of entrenched traditionalism in residential architecture in North America. Houses were expected to display historical motifs as a reflection of the owners’ good taste, harkening back to a romantic representation of traditional domestic values and an idyllic suburban lifestyle. This house displays only a cautious embrace of modernism, and includes Period Revival elements, such as complex steeply-pitched rooflines, built-in flower boxes, and a mixture of diamond leaded casement windows and multi-paned double-hung windows that demonstrate a vestigial influence of the British Arts and Crafts style. An efficient and rational floor plan with smaller rooms arranged around a central living room, reflected the reality that most families, during this period of austerity, could no longer afford domestic help. Further value is attained for this residence’s association with first owners Alan Webster and his wife, Edith. Alan Webster, who studied at the University of British Columbia, was employed as an Engineer with the Canadian Government. This house was constructed by J. Northey & Son at a cost of $4,000.",

Wooden lapped siding and shingle siding provide contrasting texture to the wall surfaces. This house additionally exhibits a number of stained glass leaded windows with an Arts and Crafts motif. The first owners of this residence were Alfred M. Parsons (1883-1905) and his wife Beatrice May (née Clapp, 1887-1947).

Built circa 1938, the Armitage House is an excellent example of an English Cottage-style home common to the region and to the country in the 1920s and 30s, but now much less familiar. It is strongly reminiscent of the catalogue houses that were offered in North America by the Sears Modern Homes Program (1908-1940). The design of this house is interesting for being remarkably similar to the 'Yates Model 3711', which the Sears catalogue described as 'a mellow house, pleasantly flavored with English-cottage characteristics.' The English Cottage design was popular with the emerging middle class (to which the Armitages belonged) as it was both attractive and affordable. It espoused the Arts and Crafts movement through its design elements, such as an asymmetrical façade, a window pattern that reflects the interior room functions, orientation of the house to take advantage of natural lighting, minimal use of picturesque detail, and the overall design emphasis of function showing through design. This house is significant for having very few changes in the original exterior design elements, making it easily readable as a 1930’s catalogue English Cottage home. The location of the house on the edge of comfortable Queen’s Park speaks to an upwardly-mobile family, and the house itself is a physical connection to the George Armitage family. George was important to New Westminster as the long-time manager of the Valley Lumber Company.",

The use of a crossed-mullion pattern, as seen in this house, was typical of Sait’s work.

Electric Railway Company was extending its interurban system east to Chilliwack, to serve the fledgling agricultural communities and forest industries of the Fraser Valley. The 'Market', 'Milk', 'Mail' and 'Owl' trains provided rail links between the metropolitan areas and the upper valley, facilitating rapid development in the sparsely settled lands to the east. The Fraser Valley line opened on November 6, 1910, and established patterns of settlement that, despite the line's closure in 1950, are still evident today. This landmark building was designed in 1909 and constructed in 1910-11, and included offices and the dispatch centre for the interurban system. The design allowed interurban cars to pass though the building diagonally to connect the Front Street and Columbia Street rail tracks though a large opening on Eighth Street. Its location opposite the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) station integrated local, regional and national transportation systems. Additionally, the BCER Company building is significant for its contribution to the consistent and distinctive built form of Columbia and Front Streets, which dates from 1898 to 1913, when New Westminster was the major centre of commerce and industry for the booming Fraser Valley area. Further heritage value lies in the building's architecture, designed by the prominent Vancouver-based architectural firm Maclure and Fox, the partnership of Samuel Maclure (1860-1929) and Cecil Croker Fox (1879-1916) who were best known for their numerous prestigious residential projects.",

He had a successful career in architecture, including the New Westminster Carnegie Library (1902-04) and several large structures at the Provincial Exhibition grounds in Queen’s Park. The use of a crossed-mullion pattern, as seen in this house, was typical of Sait’s work. Other elements of the design reflect the transitional nature of residential architecture in the mid-Edwardian era, when the newly-fashionable Classical Revival style was supplanting the picturesque eclecticism of the Victorian era.",

These romantic themes were carried into the interior. Murals of romantic Mediterranean scenery, lanterns, plaster screens, wrought iron trellis work covered with climbing roses and twinkling stars in a midnight sky gave the patrons the illusion of being seated in an exotic walled garden. In the 1920s movies were becoming the premier form of popular entertainment; the Columbia Theatre is valued as a local representation of the growth of this Hollywood phenomenon. In 1912, Adolph Zukor established the Famous Players Film Company, which merged four years later with the Jesse L. Lasky Company to form the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation; their film distribution company was named Paramount Pictures. The Columbia was operated as part of this chain for the duration of its life as a movie theatre.  Additionally, the Columbia Theatre is valued for its architecture. Its architects, Fred Laughton Townley (1887-1966) and Robert Michael Matheson (1887-1935) were best known for their design of Vancouver City Hall. In the inter-war period this firm flourished as one of the leaders in the use of traditional period revival styles as well as in their exploration of modernism, particularly in their sophisticated institutional work. After the construction of the Columbia Theatre, Townley and Matheson became the local architects for Famous Players. The interior decoration was undertaken by Girvan Studios of Vancouver, led by John Girvan (1876-1957).",

The rear of the building faces Front Street, where the sloping site exposes the lower level, and provides the opportunity for a secondary storefront. The Dupont Block is significant for its contribution to the consistent and distinctive built form of Columbia and Front Streets, which dates from 1898 to 1913, when New Westminster was the major centre of commerce and industry for the booming Fraser Valley area. A three-storey brick and stone block was completed on this site in 1891, designed by architect G.W. Grant for Victoria investors D.R. Harris and Major Charles T. Dupont. After its destruction in the Great Fire of 1898, Dupont financed a replacement two-storey block, also designed by Grant, that incorporated the still-standing walls of the earlier structure. Completed in 1899, this was one of the largest ground floor areas covered by a single building in the province. The Dupont Block was designed in the Victorian Italianate style, with a chamfered corner entry and arched window hoods. The exterior of the building was finished in a mortar stucco to disguise the fire-ravaged walls of the earlier building. In 1910, the western portion of the building was redeveloped as the Edison Theatre. The Dupont Block is additionally valued for its association with its architect George William Grant (1852-1925), a prolific architect, who designed many of the buildings in downtown New Westminster, before and after the Great Fire. He redesigned and restored buildings that survived, and designed replacement blocks for those that were destroyed, much reduced in scale and opulence from the pre-fire buildings.",

The design of this house, with its prominent corner turret with an iron finial, hipped roof with lower cross gables and wraparound verandah, was inspired by a design by New York architect H. Hudson Holly, found in a popular pattern book, \"Detail, Cottage and Constructive Architecture\", printed by New York publisher, William T. Comstock in 1886. The use of a pattern book design demonstrates the evolution of popular architectural tastes and the wide influence of these standardized plan books on vernacular architecture.",

The Gilley Residence is significant for its unusual construction history. A 1912 renovation amalgamated portions of two adjacent, earlier houses, the circa 1890 Herbert Gilley House and the 1888 wing of the John Hendry mansion, \"Hillcroft\". Substantial portions of these two houses were relocated and joined through the use of a consistent new roofline and a new central entry. Despite the different styles of the two earlier houses, the resulting composition is remarkably harmonious, employing Classical Revival elements to visually unite the ornate and varied detailing.  Additionally, the Gilley Residence is valued for its associated with Herbert Gilley (1862-1941), who owned the original circa 1890 Queen Anne portion of the building, and subdivided the former Hendry estate to move his home from the adjacent property and sell the other lots as a high-class subdivision in 1912. Gilley was a partner, with his brother, Walter R. Gilley, in Gilley Bros., a successful lumber and cartage company. Gilley Street in New Westminster was named after the brothers. The Gilley Residence is significant both for the design of the 1912 renovation and for the surviving Queen Anne and Victorian Italianate architecture of the two earlier houses. The architect for the 1912 renovations was Edmund John Boughen (1874-1967).",

This house, one of the earliest in this neighbourhood, was built in 1890 for Alexander M. Hennessey, who worked as a boot and shoemaker on Columbia Street. The site was relatively remote from downtown, but was desirable due to its location across from Moody Square (now Moody Park), and for its panoramic views south to the Fraser River. Hennessey and his family of six occupied the house until 1894; he died at the age of 70 in 1902. During the Edwardian era, New Westminster was the major centre of commerce and industrial output for the Fraser Valley, reflected in a boom in residential construction.

This dwelling is distinguished by its hipped roof with front-gabled projection, half-timbering in the gable peak, and tapered porch columns.Constructed in 1925, the James & Margaret Whitelaw House is significant as an example of a late Craftsman bungalow, exemplified by its tapered square porch columns and half-timbering in the gable peaks. The Craftsman style was popularized through periodicals and plan books, expressing both the traditional aspects of the Arts and Crafts movement as well as modern lifestyles. Efficient, rational floor plans, where small rooms were situated around central living rooms, reflected the reality that most families, especially after the end of the First World War, could no longer afford domestic help. This house was constructed by the Lane Brothers contracting company at a cost of $3,000. Further value is attained through this historic house’s association with the ongoing development of the West End neighbourhood in New Westminster. Initial stages of development began in the late 1880s with the subdivision of what was mainly pioneer land, consisting of bush and orchards. Development continued swiftly until the end of the Edwardian-era building boom. During the period between the two world wars, development continued with construction of many single-family dwellings. The James & Margaret Whitelaw House is typical of middle-class housing in the West End.",

				"Descriptn" : "The James B. Whitburn Residence is a one-and-one-half storey, wood-frame British Arts and Crafts house located on the north side of Fourth Avenue in the Queen's Park neighbourhood in New Westminster. It features stucco cladding, two projecting front gables, decorative half-timbering and the consistent use of leaded casement windows. This residence is valued for its association with its architect and first owner, James Boulton Whitburn. Whitburn’s first known commission in B.C. was the design for a welcome arch erected in Burnaby for the 1912 vice-regal visit of the Duke and Duchess of Connaught. In June 1913, he opened an office in New Westminster, but given the downturn in the economy, his practice consisted mainly of residential projects. In the late 1920s, he received some substantial commissions, notably Trapp Technical School (later John Robson School), 1928, and Richard McBride School, 1929, both in New Westminster. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhitburn’s own house, built in 1927, demonstrates his affinity and his training in the British Arts and Crafts tradition. The modest scale and historical elements impart a storybook cottage character to the Whitburn Residence. In North America, the 1920s were a time of entrenched traditionalism in residential architecture, harkening back to the domestic values and ideals of an earlier age. It was considered the height of good taste at the time for houses to conform to a recognizable historical appearance. Additional significance is derived from the second owners of the house, Reverend Canon Frank Plaskett and his wife Mary Plaskett (née Draper, 1885-1976).",

Built in 1910-11 and altered in subsequent renovations in 1937 and 1941, the John & Annie Chamberlain Residence is valued as a picturesque example of a Storybook Cottage residence. During the years between the two world wars, domestic styles in North America were resolutely historicist. In order to display good taste, it was expected that a house would have an identifiable period revival style. As economics dictated that houses of the time were generally modest, they often assumed a cottage appearance that provided a romantic ideal of traditional domesticity, harkening back to the values and ideals of an earlier age. The American Sesquicentennial in 1926 reinforced this historicist trend, and the most popular Hollywood movies of the time were swashbuckling costume dramas. This romantic influence is demonstrated in the asymmetrical roofline, which swoops in a 'catslide' over the front entry, multi-paned windows and rustic materials. The first owners of the house were John B. Chamberlain (1832-1956) and his wife Annie (1883-1944). Originally from St. Norbert, Manitoba, John was employed as a mechanic with the British Columbia Electric Railway Company. The Chamberlains had five children before moving in 1915. The house was acquired by the Denchel family, then in 1921 by Frederick and Margaret Spooner.",

Furthermore, these twin cottages provide a rare surviving demonstration of the entrepreneurial spirit of pioneer women, an often overlooked aspect of early community settlement. Maria Keary (1824-1911) was an Irish immigrant who arrived in New Westminster in 1860 to join her husband, James Keary, a Royal Engineer. Widowed in 1871, Maria supported her family by running the family home as a boarding house. To further supplement her income, in 1887 she purchased a lot and financed the construction of these two cottages as rental properties.

Constructed at the height of the local building boom in 1911, the McClughan Residence is a testament to the Edwardian-era development of the Brow of the Hill neighbourhood. Initially conceived by Colonel Moody as a neighbourhood for the working classes, Brow of the Hill is characterized by its steep topography and expansive views of the Fraser River.

The sustained industrial and business activity in New Westminster’s core continued to spur residential development during the Edwardian era. During the First World War, the area was home to many factory workers employed in the North Arm waterfront area. The first owners of this vernacular house were the McClughan family.

Built on the steep slope of the south side of Columbia Street, the main commercial street in New Westminster's historic downtown core, it has a two storey form on the front facade, with three storeys at the rear. The Paramount Theatre is historically important as one of the oldest surviving motion picture theatre buildings in B.C. Established in 1903 by Frank Kerr, the Edison Theatre moved into the western half of the 1899 Dupont Block in 1910. It was common at this time to convert existing spaces into theatres rather than construct new buildings specifically for that use, as there was concern that the movies would prove to be a passing fad. In 1948 the theatre was leased to Paramount-Famous Players, who completed interior and exterior renovations, including a new neon sign with the name Paramount Theatre. The front facade recalls a period when New Westminster's downtown was still a regional commercial, retail and entertainment centre, prior to the arrival of the automobile-oriented suburban shopping malls. Downtown areas such as Columbia Street contained all essential services for the expanding population, with movie houses being an essential cultural element. The Paramount Theatre was highly significant to the community, as television was not yet widely available and movies were the main form of public entertainment. Despite its closure as a movie theatre, the Paramount continues to be used for entertainment purposes.",

In 1872, Cridge became embroiled in a theological controversy with the Anglican Church in Victoria over the issue of ritualism. In 1874, the acrimonious conflict ended with Cridge's trial before an ecclesiastical tribunal, where he was found guilty of insubordination, a verdict later upheld by the civil courts.

The Telford Block is a good typical example of commercial building in the Edwardian era, combining ground floor commercial space with residential accommodation on two floors above. The Block’s planning (the architect is noted on the Building Permit application as Daniel McAuley) allowed for an efficient central stair access to the apartments between two commercial spaces. The restrained detailing, common for standard commercial buildings of the era, employs small flourishes for the ground floor entries and fenestration, on the main face of the building, and at the parapet, for an overall handsome effect. Its brick material is important and valued for being carefully detailed.   The Telford Block’s list of residents over the decades is a valuable cultural record of the New Westminster society over the early decades of the 20th Century, and a record of the co-resident mix of working class and middle class populations, including mostly workers (millworkers, machinists, plumbers, for example), service sector workers (confectioner, attendant at the Provincial Mental Hospital, for example) and white-collar workers (transit dispatcher, for example).",

Typical of the Queen Anne style is the complex, irregular form, as expressed through its picturesque roofline and projecting front bay that balances the partial-width front verandah. The first owner was W.H. Falding (1858-1931), Registrar of the Supreme Court of BC, who owned the house until 1907.

				"Descriptn" : "The Wintemute House is a one and one-half storey Craftsman bungalow, identifiable by its full-width open verandah with grouped square columns, and side gabled roof with central front shed dormer. It is located on the quiet residential street of Fifth Avenue, near Queen's Park. Built in 1912, the Wintemute House is valued as a good example of a Craftsman bungalow, a popular residential style in the early twentieth century. Designed by Vancouver-based architect, William P. White, and constructed by local builder, Burton Smith, the style exhibits an almost complete rejection of classically inspired design details and instead features a rich textural contrast of siding and shingles and plain detailing. The character of the house is enhanced by a surviving Monkey Puzzle tree that was planted circa 1912 as one of a pair flanking the front of the house.  The Wintemute House is associated with Errol Irving Wintemute (1886-1937) and his wife, Martha Jane Wintemute (1886-1972), who lived in this house between 1912 and 1943. Irving Wintemute, who was born in New Westminster, was a mining recorder for the provincial government, with responsibilities including the orderly staking of claims and dispute resolution. Nicknamed \"Punk\", Wintemute became famous in the Royal City when he played for the New Westminster Salmonbellies Lacrosse Club, which won the 1908 Minto Cup championship. The house is also associated with Dennis and Yvonne Cocke, who were responsible for having the house designated as a Municipal Heritage Site in 1985.",

In 1921 a new synagogue opened at Heatley and Pender and it was used until the end of 1947. This building had a capacity of 600. On September 13th 1945, the site of our present Synagogue was purchased, building was started in 1947 and completed by the end of September of that year. The Synagogue was officially opened on January 25th 1948. At that time it was the most modern and largest Synagogue west of Montreal. The Synagogue was designed to be a house of prayer (Bait Tefila), House of Learning (Beit Midrash), and House of Meeting (Beit Knesset). The oak Aron Kodesh which we presently see on entering the main sanctuary was built originally in about 1921 for the Synagogue at Heatley and Pender. The Congregation acquired property on October 2nd 1957, which was immediately to the north of the Synagogue.  The purpose was to accommodate offices, Classrooms, a large Auditorium, and other facilitites. Construction began in the early part of 1963 and it was completed for the High Holidays of the same year.",

				"Descriptn" : "Communities have always found ways to welcome visitors and to mark special days. In early British Columbia, such occasions were often marked by firing cannons, ringing bells, and three hearty cheers. But another form of recognition was used in BC and other places as well the firing of anvils! The firing of anvils as a form of salute has a long history. In BC they frequently welcomed the arrival of a new stern wheel steamboat. Here and in other places they marked special days and festivities. The process involves placing a little gunpowder between two anvils and igniting it. In the resulting explosion, the top anvil flies upward, a lot of smoke surrounds the park, and the noise is similar to cannon fire. In the late 1800s, a group of men in New Westminster fired an anvil salute to the sovereign when other more recognized means were not available. That annual salute, continued from that time until today, is now carried out by the renowned Ancient and Honourable Hyack Anvil Battery, to mark Victoria Day in honour of the reigning monarch and the memory of Queen Victoria. The salute has also been fired on special occasions such as a visit by Royalty, and the shots are always carried out in a formal, dignified manner as befits a proper salute. Don't miss this proud group in scarlet uniforms reminiscent of an early fire brigade, as they proudly continue an important part of the local cultural heritage and history.",

				"Descriptn" : "The Holbrook Block is a three-storey masonry hotel, with arched window hoods and a projecting cornice. The upper floors retain their late Victorian-era appearance, while the ground level storefront has been restored to its 1940 Streamline Moderne appearance. It is located on the south side of Columbia Street, the main commercial street in New Westminster's historic downtown core. HERITAGE VALUE: The Holbrook Block is valued for its continued use as a saloon and hotel since 1899. Additionally, the Holbrook Block is significant for its contribution to the consistent and distinctive built form of Columbia Street, which dates from 1898 to 1913, when New Westminster was the major centre of commerce and industry for the booming Fraser Valley area. In the 1880s, Henry Holbrook constructed a brick and stone block facing Columbia Street and the wooden Holbrook Hotel facing Front Street. Both structures were destroyed by the Great Fire in 1898. The following year the Holbrook Estate, managed by local businessman and then Mayor Thomas Ovens, financed this $20,000 brick replacement, dubbed the Holbrook House. The Holbrook Block is also significant for its late Victorian-era architecture, and displays modest Victorian Italianate styling on the upper floors, reflected in its segmented arch window hoods, connected by a continuous horizontal band. The storefront was renovated in 1939-1940, and its Streamline Moderne appearance was recently restored including replica neon signage. The Holbrook Block is valued for its architectural associations. George William Grant (1852-1925), the original architect, designed many of the buildings in downtown New Westminster before and after the Great Fire. Gardiner and Mercer, one of the more enduring and prolific architectural partnerships in the province, were responsible for the 1913 renovation that added a third storey to the structure. Architects Watson and Blackadder designed the storefront renovation in 1939-1940.",

Heritage Value: The Land Registry Office is a significant legacy of New Westminster's role as an administrative centre. The distribution of Crown Land as well as the registration of land transactions was a key function of the colonial government. New Westminster, as the capital of the Mainland Colony, and later as the first capital of the province of British Columbia, was the location of the original Land Registry in 1860. The Land Registry was housed in various offices until the construction of this substantial building during the western boom years, an indication of the volume of land sales at the time. The building remained as the local Land Registry in New Westminster until 1980. Furthermore, the Land Registry Office is significant for its contribution to the consistent and distinctive built form of downtown New Westminster, which dates from 1898 and 1913, when the city was the major centre of commercial and industrial output for the booming Fraser Valley area. Built in 1910-11, the building is significant for its association with architect Edwin George William Sait (1867-1949), who had a notable architectural practice in New Westminster in the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1898. Sait drew the original designs in 1909; construction on the project was felt to be too slow, and Frank G. Gardiner (1878-1966) replaced him as supervising architect.",
