				"Descriptn" : "After moving to Vancouver from Los Angeles in 1970 to avoid Vietnam, Joseph Gregory Freedman found work on B.C.'s tugboats. Inspired by the spectacular nature of the Pacific coast, he also began to paint. While he had his first one-man show in 1972, his art would be a great love but a secondary pursuit for the next 31 years. At the age of 51, after retiring from Vancouver's SeaBus as a distinguished captain, painting became his second, full-time career. The realization of a life's dream, it was still a challenging decision. We had a beautiful heritage home in North Vancouver, and we were house-proud. Retiring early meant giving that up, but Marilyn (my wife) said, \"forget the house and paint\". So I did. His second one-man show, in 2002, was celebrated nationally, receiving accolades from CBC, The Arts Report and a feature article in NUVO magazine; his paintings since have found their way to buyers throughout North America. Humour lurks beneath the darker themes of Freedman's fascinating canvases. The Georgia Straight Really accessible work . . .  the kind of art you feel relaxed with. Susan Westmorland, The Arts Report, CBC Radio 1 The West Coast's answer to [Canada's foremost magic realist painter] Alex Colville. Vancouver Sun columnist, Denny Boyd Freedman doesn't follow fashion, he doesn't copy anybody.  That's very special in Canadian art today. Canadian artist and educator, Gordon Smith.

No dance experience is necessary. At its most basic, it's free-form movement inspired by the music. We allow our bodies to move freely without judgment or concern for what it looks like. That exhortation to dance like nobody's watching ... this is the place to do it! Sometimes it's called moving meditation. Like meditation and yoga, this type of dance strengthens the mind-body-spirit connection. It's a perfect space in which to try new things and push the envelope, as there's no structure or formal facilitation. If dancers wish to interact, then the process can be very social, the music inspiring an almost tribal feel to the connection that develops. But every dancer is there to do his or her own practice, and that individual intention is respected at all times by the other dancers. Events coming to New West in 2014.

The house has architectural value as an excellent example of an Edwardian Vernacular-style house, particularly for its hipped roof form, which is reflected in the roof over the verandah, the wood shingle siding, and the covered verandah that runs the full width of the house. Equally important is the extent of original design elements and material that have been maintained through the years. The house is also valued for its association with Josephine Slater, a well-known local dancer, dance teacher and actress, who was active in the Royal City Players, and for the Lynden Dance School, which Miss Slater operated out of the house for a number of years.",

				"Descriptn" : "The Vagabond Players Theatre Society is an integral part of New Westminster's history.  The society was formed in 1937 with a series of one-act plays staged at St. Aidan's Church.  The Vagabonds move to Queens Park occurred in 1950 when the City of New Westminster furnished the society with the fisheries building that became its current home.  In January 1951, the first production, Strange Bedfellows, was staged. Since then, Vagabond Players have continued to produce four or five-play seasons with a wonderful variety of shows.  Many well-known performers have trod the boards, including Dolores Kirkwood, Bruno Gerussi, Mildred Franklin, Ed Harrington and Raymond Burr.  Many improvements have been made over the years.  The stage was added in 1955.  The club built on a lobby, green room and dressing rooms, bought the theatre seats, and created and equipped the booth.  Everything that turned the fisheries facility into a theatre was built through the Vagabond Players, often with the help of loans from the City.  In 1997 the playhouse was renamed THE BERNIE LEGGE THEATRE in honour of Bernie Legge, one of Vagabond's most venerated actors.  Since then, many more improvements have taken place, including new washrooms, better seats, and a fully developed basement with costume room, storage and scene-shop.  A huge number of volunteer hours have gone into all this work, and it is the support of these volunteers that enables this wonderful theatre organization to continue providing great, affordable live theatre to the citizens of New Westminster.",
