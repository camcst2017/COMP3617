The Cathedral houses many important works of art including a painting by Joe Plaskett and the earliest stained glass windows made by Henry Bloomfield and sons.  Furnishings in the Cathedral include pieces of 19th century embroidery, a lectern given by Sir James Douglas, and candles sticks and a credence table donated following the great fire of 1898 by Westminster Abbey.",
